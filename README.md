Years ago, I discovered programming. Since then, I have grown a passion for it because of the amount of thinking involved. After a while, I learned that I could use programming to solve problems, so I began writing small programs. Gradually, I learned how to make websites fast and expandable. Today, I solve other peopleâ€™s problems by building websites.
